    <h4><b>Review - Hamtam</b></h4>
			Welcome to the review page of Group Hamtam.
			<p><u>Group review:</u><p>
<p>Even though our product may not be the highest vote nor fanciful, but it still met the requirements:<p>

<p><li>Design and fabricated the launcher despite of time constraints</li></p>
<p><li>Able to fly a long distance (~5.8m) - based on the actual competitions</li></p>
<p><li>able to rotate our airplane launcher left and right (180 deg) using the servo motor attached at the bottom.</li></p>

<p><u>Personal reflections:</u><p>
<p>Zi Wei:<p>
<p>The reason why I come for this Engineering Academy Programme was because I am keen in learning new things, and since it’s during the school holidays, I would like to make the best out of my time to do something meaningful and beneficial.
Through this programme, I learnt quite a few thing - Working as a team in groups of people who you are not familiar with, learning how to use and operate the Arduino a little , got myself expose to create a website using CSS in  HTML, and lastly, we did some hands on work to produce our product (able to witnessed the process of using laser cutting was a very awesome experience to me).
Even though that there was time limit given to us, and not everyone in the group can agree to the same timing to come together to work on our project as we have our own schedules, but eventually we did everything that we could and produced a product. I feel that they are putting us to the test to exceed our capabilities and to see what can we do with constraints given to us.
Last but not least I would like to thank the teachers for being so patient to teach us, guiding us and giving suggestions on how we can further improve on our ideas and products.<p>

<p>Morris:<p>
<p>During the programme, I am exposed to learning new things I never learnt before. During the 3 day programme, I was being grouped up with two other students from a different course then I am which made a awkward relationship between us. However all of that is being resolved after we introduced ourselves and started working together in our project. I was being introduced to the basics of Arduino and learnt how to create my own website by using CSS and HTML. Even though there was a time limit given to us, we still managed to put in all our effort and time to finish the project on time.It was a very fun and interesting experience for me even though I had to go through some problems throughout the entire EA programme.<p>
