    <h3><b>Review - Hamtam</b></h3>
			Welcome to the review page of Group Hamtam.
			<p style="font-size: 20px"><b><u>Group review:</u></b></p>
<p>Even though our product may not have the highest vote or the best aesthetics, it still met the requirements given to us:<p>

<p><li>Design and fabricated a automated way to deliver messages. (Even under time constraints)</li></p>
<p><li>Able to travel a long distance (~5.8m) - based on the actual competitions</li></p>
<p><li>Able to rotate. (Using the servo motor attached at the bottom.)</li></p>
<p>So what can we improve on if we had more time/experience...</p>
<p>- Well, we can maybe add linear control to the speed of the motors using a wireless controller and also add tilt control to the launcher. This would allow remote operation and more precise control to achieve better results.</p>
<p>So what went wrong during the Try-out? And how was it resolved?</p>
<p>- The diameter of our flywheel that launches the paper plane was too large, causing the rubber bands to rub against each other. To solve this, we laser cust another flywheel with a smaller diameter to allow the paper plane to have enough grip to the flywheel during launch.</p>
<p>What could we have done better?</p>
<p>- We could come up with a more structured plan for us to follow, so that we could create the product with better use of time. We could also have more research done so that we have a better idea on how our product will be made.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px"><b><u>Personal reflections:</u></b></p>
<p>Zi Wei:</p>
<p>The reason why I come for this Engineering Academy Programme was because I am keen in learning new things, and since it’s during the school holidays, I would like to make the best out of my time to do something meaningful and beneficial.
Through this programme, I learnt quite a few thing - Working as a team in groups of people who you are not familiar with, learning how to use and operate the Arduino a little , got myself expose to create a website using CSS in  HTML, and lastly, we did some hands on work to produce our product (able to witnessed the process of using laser cutting was a very awesome experience to me).
Even though that there was time limit given to us, and not everyone in the group can agree to the same timing to come together to work on our project as we have our own schedules, but eventually we did everything that we could and produced a product. I feel that they are putting us to the test to exceed our capabilities and to see what can we do with constraints given to us.
Last but not least I would like to thank the teachers for being so patient to teach us, guiding us and giving suggestions on how we can further improve on our ideas and products.</p>

<p>Morris:</p>
<p>During the programme, I am exposed to learning new things I never learnt before. During the 3 day programme, I was being grouped up with two other students from a different course then I am which made a awkward relationship between us. However all of that is being resolved after we introduced ourselves and started working together in our project. I was being introduced to the basics of Arduino and learnt how to create my own website by using CSS and HTML. Even though there was a time limit given to us, we still managed to put in all our effort and time to finish the project on time.It was a very fun and interesting experience for me even though I had to go through some problems throughout the entire EA programme.</p>

<p>Arian:</p>
<p>Being interested to discover new thing led me to join this try-out. This allows me to learn new things which I never knew where to start from as I can't find the right resources and time to learn it. With the resources given to me, and challenges to solve, I am able to work towards finding a solution instead of just messing around with no real goal. With access to tools and resources within my disposal, I am able to use implement my skills during this try-out into something useful. At the same time, I am being tested on my capabilities and team work when we 3 came together as a group to solve a common problem which was given to us. Well, at the end we managed to come up with a working product even when we met several time constraints during our journey. It has been a exciting journey in this try-out where I get to work with new people and learn new stuff.</p>
