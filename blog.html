    <h5>Our project</h5>

    <p style="font-size: 13px;">
      <b id="Day1">Day 1:</b>
      We were assigned to make a sturdy bridge of size 30 cm by 5 cm. The bridge is to be built with only 2 stacks of ice cream sticks. Our bridge was built with around 50 ice cream sticks to strengthen the frame of our bridge.  We managed to win the third strongest bridge among 7 other teams that we competed with.
      Then we learned how to use html and CSS to make our very own website to post our progress.
      Next, we given a task where we each needed to brainstorm a design to pass a message across a distance and how accurate can the design be to reach its destination. We came up with many ideas like catapults, paper airplane and slingshots. Then we decided to make our product to be paper planes. 2 of us worked on the accuracy of the plane while the third person worked on how far his paper plane can fly. During the test, both the paper planes that were for accuracy didn’t make it very well but the long distance plane worked out.
      Later in the afternoon, we learned how to use Arduino which is the fundamental of blinking the LED. At first, we learned how to operate 2 LEDs to light up alternately using the commands we implemented onto our laptops. After that we were given a task to make 3 LEDs to act as a traffic light. All these would require a loop in order for the LED to repeat its actions, in order to set a variable, we need to include in (#define …) to give the variable a name.
      All of these projects we did required us to have good teamwork. Initially we were all strangers to each other and things were a little awkward. However, we managed to come together and work with one another in order to achieve accomplishment. Thus this proves that we are able to work well with people we do not know at first.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 13px;"><b>Day 2:</b>
      Task given to us:
      1. Get Designs for webpage
      2. Get & Compile content for webpage.
      3. Research on message delivery method.
      4. Test design.
      Things learnt:
      The “~” sign on the Arduino is when you need to have the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).
      Use an Amplifier to increase the current.
      Got to expose to servo motor.
      We also went to do some research on how we want our design to be like by referring to Youtube videos for references.
      We also played around with the DC motor and Servo motor to familiarise its function and how we can use it for our launcher design. We set the Servo motor to only rotate 180deg - left to right which is for the requirement. In addition, we added some weight on top of the servo motor to test out roughly how much weight it can withstand.
      Got our finalise drawings for fabricating done before we went home.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 13px;"><b>Day 3:</b>
      Our product consist of
      acrylic,
      rubber band,
      2 DC motors and
      a servo motor.
      Wires
      Arduino UNO
      Reinforcement: Super glue and masking tape.
      Description:
      Acrylic is the body of the launcher.
      The rubber band is attached to the circle acrylic at the circumference so that when launching the airplane, there will be a pulling force acted on the plane to launch it.
      DC motor is to turn in a high revolution to launch our paper airplane far.
      Servo motor is to rotate our product left and right.
      Arduino is for us to programme it then connect it to our launcher for it to operate.
      At around 10am, we went to use laser cutting machine to get our accurate dimensions out from an A3 acrylic. After that we used super glue to assemble it together.
      After assembling our product, at 4pm we had a competition to see whose paper airplane can fly the farthest.
